### Rethink Reading. Rediscover Knowledge

What if every time you opened a PDF, it didn't just sit there—it spoke to you, connected ideas, and narrated meaning across your entire library?
That's the future we're building — and we want you to help shape it.

### The Journey Ahead

**Round 1:**
Kick things off by building the brains — extract structured outlines from raw PDFs with blazing speed and pinpoint accuracy. Then, power it up with on-device intelligence that understands sections and links related ideas together.

**Round 2:**
It's showtime! Build a beautiful, intuitive reading webapp using Adobe's PDF Embed API. You will be using your Round 1 work to design a futuristic webapp.

### Why This Matters

In a world flooded with documents, what wins is not more content — it's context. You're not just building tools — you're building the future of how we read, learn, and connect. No matter your background — ML hacker, UI builder, or insight whisperer — this is your stage.

Are you in?

It's time to read between the lines. And build a PDF experience that feels like magic. Let's go.
