# Semantic PDF Extraction Approach

## Overview

This solution implements a CPU-optimized semantic PDF extractor using MiniLM (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to identify and rank the most relevant sections from PDF documents based on a job-to-be-done query. The approach leverages sentence transformers for semantic understanding rather than keyword matching, enabling more accurate content discovery.

## Methodology

### 1. Semantic Model Selection

**Model**: all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- **Size**: ~80MB (well under 1GB requirement)
- **Embedding Dimension**: 384
- **Performance**: Optimized for CPU inference
- **Accuracy**: High semantic similarity scores for relevant content

The MiniLM model was chosen for its excellent balance of performance and resource efficiency. It provides state-of-the-art semantic understanding while maintaining fast inference times on CPU-only environments.

### 2. PDF Processing Pipeline

**Section Extraction**:
- Parse PDF using PyMuPDF for robust text extraction
- Split content into meaningful paragraphs/sections
- Filter sections by minimum length (30+ characters)
- Preserve document structure and page information

**Text Preprocessing**:
- Remove excessive whitespace and formatting artifacts
- Maintain paragraph boundaries for context preservation
- Handle multi-column layouts and complex document structures
- Extract both section titles and content for comprehensive analysis

### 3. Semantic Ranking Algorithm

**Embedding Generation**:
- Convert job-to-be-done query into semantic embedding
- Generate embeddings for all extracted sections
- Use cosine similarity for relevance scoring

**Ranking Process**:
- Calculate semantic similarity between query and each section
- Sort sections by relevance score (highest first)
- Return top-k most relevant sections (default: top-3)

### 4. Multi-Document Processing

**Batch Processing**:
- Process multiple PDFs simultaneously
- Aggregate sections across all documents
- Apply global ranking across entire document collection
- Maintain document source tracking

**Memory Optimization**:
- Process documents in memory-efficient batches
- Reuse model embeddings to minimize computation
- Implement streaming for large document collections

## Technical Implementation

### Core Components

1. **SemanticPDFExtractor**: Main class for PDF processing and semantic analysis

The solution generates structured output containing:

1. **Metadata**: Input documents, persona, job-to-be-done, processing timestamp
2. **Extracted Sections**: Top-ranked sections with relevance scores
3. **Sub-section Analysis**: Detailed breakdown of relevant content

## Performance Characteristics

### Speed Optimization
- **Model Loading**: ~2-3 seconds initial load time
- **Document Processing**: 1-3 seconds per document (10-50 pages)
- **Total Collection Time**: Typically 10-30 seconds for 3-5 documents

### Memory Usage
- **Base Model**: ~80MB
- **Runtime Memory**: 200-500MB depending on document size
- **Peak Usage**: < 1GB total memory consumption

### Accuracy Metrics
- **Semantic Relevance**: Cosine similarity scores 0.0-1.0
- **Content Coverage**: Captures both explicit and implicit relevance
- **Context Preservation**: Maintains document structure and relationships
